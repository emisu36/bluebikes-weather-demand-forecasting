## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes 3.5M+ Bluebikes trips from Jan–Sep 2025 and integrates them with detailed daily weather data to understand how Boston’s microclimates, commuting flows, and academic rhythms shape Bluebikes usage.

Our goals:

- Identify the most active stations, routes, and demand corridors

- Measure how temperature, rain, wind, and heat influence ridership

- Detect spatial imbalances between departures and returns

- Build a foundation for weather-aware demand forecasting

- Recommend rebalancing strategies for system operators

All insights, SQL logic, dashboards, and analysis come from our end-to-end notebook.
